				<h2>WHAT IS BLACK MARKET?</h2>
				<p>is a sector of economic activity that involves illegal economic transactions, in particular the purchase and sale of merchandise illegally. The items themselves can be illegal, such as the sale of weapons or illegal drugs; merchandise can be stolen; or merchandise may be otherwise legal goods sold illegally to avoid paying taxes or license terms, such as cigarettes or unregistered firearms. It is so called because "black economy" or "black market" business is conducted outside the law, and needs to be held "in the dark", outside the eyes of the law. Black markets are said to develop when restrictions on the state places on the production or terms of goods and services that come out of conflict with market demands. They do well, then, when state restrictions get heavier, such as during bans or distributions. However, black markets are normally present in both economic capitalism and socialism. The term black market in English is known as illicit trade (formerly illegal trade, now trying to be removed because it is not appropriate) </p>
